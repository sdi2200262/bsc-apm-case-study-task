"""Service-ticket lifecycle for the mock CAS service.

Tickets are short-lived, single-use, and held in process memory. Each
ticket is minted at credentials POST and consumed at the matching
samlValidate (or serviceValidate) call. The store is reset by the
/admin/reset endpoint when the env package's reset script invokes it.
